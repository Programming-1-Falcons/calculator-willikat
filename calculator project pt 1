# you are going to make a simple calculator program that has the basic arithmetic functions built in.

# You should get 3 inputs from the user:

# input 1: what mathematical operation is being performed.
# input 2: the first number in the equation (could be float)
# input 3: the second number in the equation(could be float) 

# Your calculator should include:
# addition
# subtraction
# division (floating point)
# multiplication
# exponents
 
# your output should include the formula as well as the solution for example something like this:
# 5 + 4 = 9
# Your program should also implement a while loop so it keeps running, allowing the user to not have to re run your program each time
# they use it.
